### About me
Hello fellow code writers, 

I hope the adventure to get where you are has been one to reflect on cherishingly. As I look back, albiet not that long, I see so much growth.

I began writing code two years ago while I was teaching it, and continued to chip away at concepts while I was travelling (on a tablet and wireless keyboard). When I finally landed back home, I was at an impase... do I find something to tide me over until my next travel, and keep learning at a moderate pace, or dive in to a three month boot camp, crush, and begin a career as a web developer. 

The latter, after an enlightening three months, is the case. 

I like to think I would have gotten here on my own, but realistically, a little direction is what I needed. 

Now, I can create full-stack web applications using JS, React, Node, SQL, and restAPI's. 

[Booktale](https://booktale.netlify.app) is my first fully deployed full-stack web application wherein a user can create and contribute to a comment section linked to a unique QR code. My inspiration came from  imaginang where books on hostle bookshelves had once been, and where they might go. This project was my capstone for the boot camp I just completed and it acheives it's purpose, however, I can see much more in the future for [Booktale](https://booktale.netlify.app). 

This is your window into my house. Please be harsh on the decor. I only want to get better.
