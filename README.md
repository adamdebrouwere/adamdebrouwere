### About me
Hello fellow code scribes, 

I hope you are enjoying the adventure. As I look back, albiet not that long, I see so much to be proud of. 

I began writing code two years ago while I was teaching it, and continued to chip away at concepts while I was travelling (on a tablet and wireless keyboard). When I finally landed back home, I was at an impase... do I find something to tide me over until my next travel, and keep learning at a moderate pace, or dive in to a three month boot camp, crush, and begin a career as a web developer. 

The latter, after an enlightening three months, is the case. 

I like to believe I would have gotten here on my own, but realistically, a little direction was what I needed. Shout out to [Brainstation](https://www.brainstation.io). 

I can now create full-stack web applications using JS, React, Node, SQL, SCSS, and restAPI's. 

[Booktale](https://booktale.netlify.app) is my first fully deployed full-stack web application wherein a user can create and contribute to a comment section linked to a unique QR code. My inspiration came from used books on hostle bookshelves. I wondered about thier past lives, and where they might go. This project was my capstone for the boot camp I just completed and it acheives it's purpose, however, I can see much more in the future for [Booktale](https://booktale.netlify.app). 

Welcome to my pad. Be harsh on the decor. I only want to get better.
